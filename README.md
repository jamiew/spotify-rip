spotify-rip
===========

Some shell scripts around `spotdl` to make downloading MP3s
from Spotify easier (specifically, via playlists)

`spotdl` doesn't actually download from Spotify, it actually
finds the songs on YouTube and then fetches using `youtube-dl` lol


Setup/usage
-----------

Just run the script
